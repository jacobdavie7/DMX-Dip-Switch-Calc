Written in C, DMX Dip Calc is a calculator for DMX Address. 
Will ask you for the value of each of the 8 dip switches. Enter 1 for on (usually up) and 0 for off (usually down). After you enter your value,hit enter.

Go though all 8 switches.
The program will tell you what the DMX address that the dip switches are set too. Will also print out a picture of how the switches should look for troubleshooting.

Note:WILL NOT WORK IF THERE IS A ON OR ACTIVE DIP SWITCH. If your light has one, just make sure that switch is turned on and enter the switches the controll the address (usually the rest of them) IN THE CORRESPONDING SPOT.
